Basic Components of a Cell:a.   Cell Membrane:i.   Separates the intracellular environment from the external environment.ii.   Vital for maintaining homeostasis by regulating what enters and exits the cell.iii.   Controls ion concentrations and pH within the cell, ensuring optimal conditions for protein function.b.   Cytoplasm:i.   The liquid inside the cell that contains the organelles and proteins essential for cell life.ii.   Organelles:1.   Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): Synthesizes proteins and lipids, critical for cellular function and structure.2.   Mitochondria: The powerhouse of the cell. ProducesATP(energy) viacellular respiration(glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation), requiringoxygenandglucose, producingcarbon dioxideandwateras byproducts.c.   Nucleus:i.   Contains theDNA, which holds the genetic instructions for protein synthesis.ii.   The DNA is transcribed intomRNA, which is translated into proteins that perform. various cellular functions.Electrical Properties of Neurons1.   Resting Membrane Potential:a.   The electrical potential difference across the neuronal membrane at rest (~ -70mV).b.   This potential is primarily determined by thesodium-potassium pump(Na+/K+ ATPase), which actively transportsNa+ions out of the cell andK+ions into the cell.c.   The differential distribution of ions across the membrane creates a negative charge inside the cell relative to the outside.d.   The cell membrane is selectively permeable to certain ions, especiallyK+(which leaks out of the cell), contributing to the resting potential.2.   Changes in Membrane Potential:a.   Hyperpolarization: Occurs when the inside of the cell becomes more negative than the resting potential (more negative than ~-70mV). This is usually caused by the influx ofCl⁻ions or efflux ofK⁺ions.b.   Depolarization: Occurs when the membrane potential becomes less negative or more positive (approaching 0 mV). This is due to the influx ofNa⁺ions.Action Potential1.   Generation of Action Potential:a.   If the depolarization reaches a threshold (around -55mV), anaction potentialis initiated. The action potential is a rapid, all-or-nothing electrical event that propagates along the axon.b.   Voltage-Gated Ion Channels:i.   Sodium Channels: Open in response to depolarization, allowingNa⁺to rush into the cell, further depolarizing the membrane.ii.   Potassium Channels: Open later to allowK⁺to leave the cell, repolarizing the membrane.c.   Phases of Action Potential:i.   Resting State: All ion channels are closed.ii.   Depolarization: Sodium channels open, andNa⁺rushes in.iii.   Repolarization: Potassium channels open, andK⁺flows out.iv.   Hyperpolarization: Potassium channels remain open briefly, causing the inside of the cell to become more negative than the resting potential.v.   Refractory Period: After an action potential, the neuron briefly cannot fire another action potential (absolute refractory period), followed by a relative refractory period.2.   Propagation of Action Potential:a.   Action potentials propagate down theaxonwithout decrement, allowing the signal to travel long distances.b.   Inmyelinated axons, action potentials jump from one node of Ranvier to the next (saltatory conduction), which significantly increases conduction speed.c.   Unmyelinated axonsconduct signals more slowly as the action potential must propagate continuously along the axon.Neural Transmission1.   Excitatory and Inhibitory Signals:a.   Excitatory Transmission:i.   Increases the likelihood that the postsynaptic neuron will reach the threshold for firing an action potential.ii.   Typically mediated byglutamate(the major excitatory neurotransmitter).iii.   Depolarizes the postsynaptic cell by allowingNa+influx.b.   Inhibitory Transmission:i.   Reduces the likelihood of an action potential firing by hyperpolarizing the postsynaptic cell.ii.   Typically mediated byGABA(the major inhibitory neurotransmitter).iii.   Increases the influx ofCl⁻or efflux ofK⁺, making the inside of the cell more negative.2.   Summation of Signals:a.   Spatial Summation: Multiple signals arriving at different locations on the neuron are summed together.b.   Temporal Summation: Multiple signals arriving at the same location in rapid succession are summed together.Synaptic Transmission1.   Steps in Synaptic Transmission:a.   Action potentialreaches thepresynaptic terminal.b.   This triggers the opening ofvoltage-gated calcium channels, allowingCa²⁺to enter the presynaptic neuron.c.   The influx ofCa²⁺triggers the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft byexocytosis.d.   Neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on thepostsynaptic membrane.2.   Neurotransmitter Receptors:a.   Ionotropic Receptors: These receptors areion channelsthemselves. When bound by neurotransmitters, they open and allow ions to flow into or out of the cell, causing rapid changes in membrane potential.b.   Metabotropic Receptors: These receptors activateG-proteinsthat indirectly influence ion channels via second messenger systems (e.g., cAMP), leading to slower but prolonged effects.Cellular Protein Functions and Synthesis1.   Proteins in the Neuron:a.   Proteins are essential for nearly every function within the cell, including enzyme activity, signal transduction, structural support, and neurotransmitter synthesis.2.   Protein Synthesis:a.   DNAcontains the instructions for making proteins.b.   mRNAis transcribed from DNA and exported from the nucleus.c.   Ribosomesin the cytoplasm translate the mRNA into proteins by reading thecodonsand adding the correspondingamino acids.d.   tRNAmolecules bring amino acids to the ribosome, where they are added to the growing protein chain.3.   Axonal Transport:a.   Axonal transportmoves proteins and other materials from thecell bodyto theaxon terminals.b.   Microtubulesandmotor proteins(kinesin and dynein) facilitate the movement of materials along the axon.Gene Expression1.   Central Dogma of Molecular Biology:a.   DNA→mRNA→Protein.b.   The sequence of nucleotide bases in theDNAdictates the amino acid sequence of proteins.2.   Gene Regulation:a.   Different cells express different proteins based ongene expression, which is tightly regulated.b.   Gene expression can be assessed by measuring the presence ofmRNAor the proteins themselves.Neuroplasticity and Synaptic Changes1.   Dendritic Arborization:a.   Neurons can change their structure by growing new dendritic branches (arborization) or retracting old ones. This is a key component ofneuroplasticity, which allows for learning and memory formation.2.   Axonal Growth:a.   Axonal growth and guidance are influenced bychemoattractants(which attract axons) andchemorepellents(which repel axons).
